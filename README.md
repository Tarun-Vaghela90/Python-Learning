# My Python Learning

Hi, this is my Python learning journey. I am not an expert, and I don't do daily exercises or learning, but I try my best when I can.

## What's Here

- Some exercises and projects from the **App Brewery's Python 100 Days of Code** course.
- Notes and code I wrote while learning.

## Tools I Use

- **Python** for writing code.
- **Git** to save my progress.

## How to Start

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-learning.git
    ```
2. Check out the folders to see what I have done.
